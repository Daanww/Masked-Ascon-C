Instructions on how to compile and run the tests:
(assuming debian based machine)
-clone this project
-clone ibex-demo-system
-follow ibex instructions to get the simulation up and running:
    install the python environment
    install srecord?
    try to build the simulator, if you get errors:
        install the verible binaries (notably: verible-verilog-format) and export them in the python venv
        try to use older commit of ibex-demo-system
        install "packaging" using pip
        install libelf-dev package for "libelf.h"
-download the riscv32 gcc toolchain as mentioned on the page and add it to your path.
-maybe use "simulate.sh"
-if it cannot find the simulator binary check which binary was created by building the simulator (ibex-demo-system/build/lowrisc_ibex_demo_system_0/sim-verilator/)
